# cryptography_poc

## Overview
This project is a proof of concept designed to apply cryptography concepts from the Buena Vista University course MATH-140 by implementing a basic encoder/decoder in code.

The goal is to translate theoretical cryptographic ideas into practical implementations, with an emphasis on understanding how different encryption methods operate at a fundamental level.

## Goals
- Apply concepts learned in a cryptography course through hands-on programming
- Make encoding and decoding messages easier to experiment with through a command-line tool
- Focus primarily on classical encryption methods such as additive and multiplicative ciphers, Vigenère ciphers, and related techniques
- Explore modern public/private key encryption at a simplified, proof-of-concept level

## Planned Architecture
- Implemented in Python
- Command-line interface allowing the user to:
  - Enter text directly, or
  - Select a file as input
- Input text or files will be encrypted or decrypted based on user-specified parameters
- Due to the complexity of cryptanalysis, the user is expected to know which encryption method was used when decrypting

## Current Status
- Planning and design phase

## Next Steps
1. Implement the command-line interface
2. Implement simple encryption methods (additive and multiplicative ciphers)
3. Gradually increase complexity
